HOW TO RUN AFTER CLONING THIS PROJECT:
1) Run: npm install
2) Run: npm run devStart (to start backend server)
3) Open index.html in web browser

NOTES:
- Since PrimeNG does not support AngularJs 1.x (only Angular 2+), I used Material UI instead

NEXT STEPS:
- Implement more type safety with more interfaces
- Add rest of the flags (some go into yellowFlag, others go into redFlag)
- Search system to filter through applicants (search bar, filters, etc)
